 The TWTNibBacking protocol simply declares the +nib message. This allows users of a class to easily
 get the nib that backs it. This is useful when doing things like, e.g., registering a nib for a
 UITableViewCell reuse identifier, which can be done like so:
 
     [tableView registerNib:[NibBackedCell nib] forCellReuseIdentifier:kReuseIdentifier];

/*!
 TWTNibBackedView is an abstract class that makes it easy to create a view that is primarily laid
 out and configured using a nib. It is built to work correctly whether the view is instantiated in
 code or in a nib. 
 
 Using a nib-backed view requires that you do some basic setup.
 
     1. Set TWTNibBackedView as your nib-backed view’s superclass.
     2. In your view’s xib, set the File’s Owner’s class to your TWTNibBackedView subclass.
     3. Connect the File’s Owner contentView outlet to the top-level view in your xib.

 TWTNibBackedView attempts to choose reasonable defaults for nib-loading behavior, but allows you to
 customize it as needed. For example, by default, the nib that is used has the same name as your
 class, but if you want to change that, you can override +nibName. If you need to do something more
 complex to load a nib, you can override +nib. See the class documentation for more information.

 @discussion This outlet must be set in your xib. If it is not, an assertion will be raised when

     should not set this property outside of your xib.

     the name of the nib to load and/or +nibBundle to specify another bundle.
