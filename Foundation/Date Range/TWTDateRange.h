/*!
 TWTDateRanges model ranges of dates. They are useful for determining whether a date falls between
 two other dates. Date ranges are closed; that is, they include both their start and end dates.
 
 All the properties of TWTDateRange instances are immutable. As such, invoking ‑copy on a date range
 simply returns the receiver.
 */

 @abstract The first date in the date range. 
 @discussion By default, this is equivalent to +[NSDate distantPast]. It cannot be nil.
